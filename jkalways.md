remember to always:
- kill and restart development server every time code is changed if testing
- use mcp-db-tool to verify changes
- if testing a proposal creation uese proposal-creation-tester (let me know if changes need to be made to agent)
- re-use existing code and components whenever possible and keep solutions simple
