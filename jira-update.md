# Command: jira-update

Updates an existing Jira ticket by evaluating and enhancing it with comprehensive technical analysis based on codebase research. Always search the WD (wishdesk) tickets using atlassian mcp. 

## Usage
/jira-update [ticket-id]

## Example
/jira-update 18

## Implementation

This command will:

1. **Retrieve Existing Ticket**: Fetch the current Jira ticket details using the provided ticket ID
2. **Research Phase**: Thoroughly analyze the codebase to understand the feature/system mentioned in the ticket
   - Search for existing implementations and related code
   - Identify current architecture and patterns
   - Understand dependencies and integration points
   - Map out the data flow and component relationships
3. **Impact Analysis**: Based on codebase research, identify:
   - **Files that will need to be edited** (with specific file paths)
   - **Pages/components that will be changed** (frontend impact)
   - **API endpoints that need modification** (backend impact)
   - **Database schema changes** (if applicable)
   - **Third-party integrations affected** (if any)
4. **Component Validation**: Verify the assigned component is appropriate based on research findings
5. **Difficulty Re-assessment**: Re-evaluate difficulty (1-10) based on:
   - Number of files requiring changes
   - Complexity of existing architecture
   - Integration touchpoints identified
   - Testing requirements
6. **Impact Re-evaluation**: Re-assess impact (1-10) considering:
   - User-facing changes identified
   - Business process improvements
   - Technical debt reduction
   - Performance implications
7. **Enhanced Description**: Update ticket description with:
   - Technical requirements based on codebase analysis
   - Specific file modification list
   - UI/UX changes required
   - Testing strategy
   - Implementation approach
8. **Update Ticket**: Use Atlassian MCP tools to update the ticket with enhanced information
