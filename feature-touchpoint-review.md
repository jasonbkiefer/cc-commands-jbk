# Command: feature-touchpoint-review

Perform a comprehensive, systematic review of all feature touchpoints across frontend, backend, database, MCP servers, and data pipelines. Map all user flows, identify break points, and validate implementation quality.

## Usage
/project:feature-touchpoint-review [feature-name]

Example: `/project:feature-touchpoint-review csat-survey`

if no feature mentioned refer to the branch name or recent changes.

## Implementation

This command will:
1. **Map all user flows** - Document every way users interact with the feature
2. **Identify touchpoints** - List frontend components, backend routes, database tables, MCP servers, data pipelines
3. **Find break points** - Identify potential failure points in each flow
4. **Systematic code review** - Use Grep to examine each touchpoint individually
5. **Test scenarios** - Consider edge cases, empty states, error conditions
6. **Render decision** - Final GO/NO-GO with specific issues found

## Review Phases

### Phase 1: Feature Discovery & Flow Mapping

**Step 1A: Identify feature scope**
- Determine if feature is internal-only or customer-facing
- Identify all user roles that interact with feature
- List all entry points (URLs, buttons, API endpoints)

**Step 1B: Map user flows**
For EACH way users interact with the feature, document:
- User path: Step-by-step user actions
- Touch points: Code locations triggered by each step
- Expected behavior: What should happen
- Potential break points: Where it could fail

Example flows to consider:
- **Display flow**: How does the feature appear to users?
- **Eligibility/access flow**: Who can see/use it? How is access controlled?
- **Interaction flow**: What happens when users interact?
- **Submission/save flow**: How is data processed and saved?
- **Retrieval flow**: How is existing data fetched and displayed?
- **Edit flow**: Can users modify existing data?
- **Delete/archive flow**: Can data be removed?
- **Error flow**: What happens when things go wrong?

### Phase 2: Touchpoint Identification

**Frontend Touchpoints:**
- Components that render feature UI
- State management (Redux, context, local state)
- API calls and data fetching
- Form validation and user input handling
- Error display and loading states
- Conditional rendering logic

**Backend Touchpoints:**
- Route handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Middleware (auth, validation, error handling)
- Service layer functions
- Database helper functions
- External API calls
- Webhook triggers

**Database Touchpoints:**
- Tables involved (primary and related)
- Queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Joins and relationships
- Indexes used
- Transactions and locking
- Data validation constraints

**MCP Server Touchpoints (if applicable):**
- MCP tool endpoints
- Data transformation logic
- Input validation
- Output formatting
- Error handling

**Data Pipeline Touchpoints:**
- Input data sources
- Transformation steps
- Validation rules
- Output destinations
- Error logging

### Phase 3: Systematic Code Review

For each touchpoint identified in Phase 2:

**Step 3A: Read the code**
Use Read tool to examine full implementation

**Step 3B: Search for patterns**
Use Grep to find:
- Error handling patterns
- Validation logic
- Edge case handling
- SQL queries
- Type definitions
- Test coverage

**Step 3C: Check for common issues**
- ‚ùå Missing error handling
- ‚ùå Unvalidated user input
- ‚ùå SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Missing null/undefined checks
- ‚ùå Empty array handling
- ‚ùå Race conditions
- ‚ùå Memory leaks
- ‚ùå Type mismatches
- ‚ùå Missing authorization checks
- ‚ùå Hardcoded values that should be configurable

**Step 3D: Validate data flow**
- Trace data from input to output
- Verify type consistency
- Check transformation logic
- Validate error propagation

### Phase 4: Break Point Analysis

For each user flow, examine EVERY potential failure point:

**Data Validation Failures:**
- What if required fields are empty?
- What if data types are wrong?
- What if values are out of range?
- What if arrays are empty?
- What if objects have unexpected structure?

**Database Failures:**
- What if SQL query fails?
- What if transaction rollback is needed?
- What if foreign key constraint fails?
- What if unique constraint is violated?
- What if database connection is lost?

**API Failures:**
- What if API returns 400/500 error?
- What if API times out?
- What if response is malformed?
- What if authentication fails?
- What if rate limit is hit?

**Logic Failures:**
- What if conditional logic has edge case?
- What if loop terminates unexpectedly?
- What if recursive function hits base case wrong?
- What if async operation isn't awaited?
- What if promise rejection isn't caught?

**Integration Failures:**
- What if MCP server is unavailable?
- What if webhook delivery fails?
- What if external service is down?
- What if data format changes?
- What if version mismatch occurs?

### Phase 5: Edge Case Testing

**Empty States:**
- Empty arrays in SQL IN clauses
- Empty strings in required fields
- Null vs undefined handling
- Zero values in calculations
- Empty result sets from queries

**Boundary Cases:**
- Maximum string lengths
- Minimum/maximum numeric values
- Date ranges (past, future, timezone issues)
- Array length limits
- Nested object depth

**Concurrent Operations:**
- Multiple users editing same data
- Race conditions in async operations
- Database locking issues
- Cache invalidation problems

**Permission Scenarios:**
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Expired sessions
- Role-based access control
- Cross-tenant data access

### Phase 6: Feature-Specific Checks

**For Proposal Features:**
- Check MCP server proposal-quiz-tool endpoints
- Verify input/output data pipeline
- Test proposal creation, editing, deletion
- Verify permission checks for different roles
- Check quiz configuration loading
- Validate proposal state transitions

**For Survey/Feedback Features:**
- Check eligibility logic
- Verify submission flow
- Test coupon generation
- Validate webhook triggers
- Check duplicate submission prevention
- Verify data privacy compliance

**For Chat/Communication Features:**
- Check real-time message delivery
- Verify message persistence
- Test file upload/download
- Validate permission controls
- Check notification triggers

**For Admin Features:**
- Verify admin-only access controls
- Test bulk operations
- Check audit logging
- Validate data export functionality

**For Integration Features:**
- Test external API authentication
- Verify data synchronization
- Check error recovery mechanisms
- Validate retry logic

## Example Review Process

```
User requests: /project:feature-touchpoint-review csat-survey

Step 1: Map user flows
  - Proposal display (banner shows)
  - Eligibility check
  - Survey submission
  - Coupon display

Step 2: Identify touchpoints
  Frontend:
    - CSATSurveyBanner.tsx
    - SurveyModal.tsx
  Backend:
    - GET /proposal-op/:id
    - GET /proposals/:id
    - GET /api/csat/eligibility/:proposalId
    - POST /api/csat/response
    - GET /api/csat/coupon/:proposalId
  Database:
    - csat_responses table
    - system_settings table
  Services:
    - csat-survey-service.ts

Step 3: Systematic code review
  Read proposal-op-routes.ts
  Grep for "searchKeys" in server/routes
  Read csat-survey-service.ts
  Grep for SQL queries with IN clauses

Step 4: Break point analysis
  Discovered: Empty searchKeys array causes SQL error
  Location: proposal-op-routes.ts:634
  Impact: Proposal load fails when quiz keys are undefined
  Severity: CRITICAL

Step 5: Edge case testing
  Test: quizConfigKey = undefined, quizKey = undefined
  Result: searchKeys = []
  Query: setting_key IN ()
  Outcome: SQL syntax error

Step 6: Decision
  DECISION: üö® NO-GO
  Reason: Critical SQL error on empty searchKeys array
  Fix: Add guard: if (searchKeys.length > 0) before query
```
